# SpikeAlert

Spike is my girlfriend's dog, it loves to eat,
 especially on time (at 7pm).
 
Together we made an automation using life360 API and Selenium library
(WhatsApp on chrome web-driver) that creates a list of the people
who are at home on 7pm and sends them a WhatsApp message to feed Spike.

This project can be easily used in order to make some different WhatsApp alerts,
feel free to use it :)
